# Maze Solver

Maze Solver is a Python program that generates a random maze and solves it using the Breadth-First Search algorithm. It visually displays the maze and the path found in a simple graphical interface.

## Installation

Before running Maze Solver, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

Maze Solver uses the Tkinter library for its graphical interface, which is included in standard Python distributions. No additional libraries are required.

### Downloading the Program

You can download the `maze_solver.py` and/or `maze_with_canvas.py` file directly or clone it from this repository.

### Running Maze Solver

To run the program, open your command line or terminal and navigate to the directory containing `maze_solver.py` and `maze_with_canvas.py`. Then, execute the program by typing:

CLI version: 
```bash
python maze_solver.py
```

Graphical interface version:
```bash
python maze_with_canvas.py
```

This command will open aw indow displaying the generated maze and its solution.
